Hello, my name is Gabriel and I'm a Astrophysics M.A. student at the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS](http://www.if.ufrgs.br/posfis/index.php). I work with [Dr. Alejandra Romero](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Romero,%20A.%20D.&db_key=AST) and [Dr. S.O. Kepler](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Kepler,%20S.%20O.&db_key=AST) studying the evolution of massive white dwarfs.

I have Bsc physics degree from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG](http://furg.br). Part time of my undergrad studies was performed at [State University of New York at Oswego - SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu/) thanks to the [Science Without Borders Program ](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/).

I have experience on computational astrophysics working with variable stars and methods to detect periodicities in the light curves of those type of stars. I wrote a algorithm to calculate periods of pulsation for [Cepheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable) and [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae) stars as part of my final project for my undergrad studies.

For my masters,
